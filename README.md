# DIY_Discourse_v2.1

The project is a collaboration between the Computer Science and English departments. 
The goal is to build upon what the project already is, a system for processing large amounts of data from Reddit to gain insights into how language is being used on the website. 
Our mission is to make further improvements to the user interface and the database query times, as well as the overall usability of the application. 
These improvements will benefit the English department by further minimizing the amount of time needed for research.
